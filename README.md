# [Budget Tracker](https://fast-earth-94685.herokuapp.com/)

This is a progressive web-app which allows users to track their budget through a simple table, and a graph. Users can input a source of income/expenses, and see the graph dynamically change based on the amount of incomes/expenses they have inputted.

## Very notable feature

This PWA utilizes indexedDB to ensure that even when a user is offline, they will be able to add information to the remote database. Once they are online again, the information in the client-side database will be sent to the MongoDB database and cleared from indexedDB.
